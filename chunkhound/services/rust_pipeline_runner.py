"""Runs the Rust indexing pipeline for one process_directory() call and bridges
its progress_callback(phase, current, total, chunks=0) protocol to Rich bars.

Extracted from IndexingCoordinator.process_directory()'s `if _use_rust:`
branch and the module-scope progress-bridge class it built inline — both are
fully self-contained given plain values (Progress/TaskID/Path/bool/dict), so
neither needs the coordinator instance itself. Kept in chunkhound/services/
(not chunkhound/) because run_rust_indexing_phase() produces
process_directory()-shaped output, matching chunkhound/services/
batch_processor.py's precedent for a DB-free, plain function/class service
module.

Used by:
- IndexingCoordinator.process_directory() — calls run_rust_indexing_phase()
  when the Rust pipeline decision (_use_rust) is True.

    # producing lock errors or, worse, silent on-disk corruption
    # that only surfaces later as a deserialization error when
    # some other process reopens the DB.
    #
    # Safe to close here: the parse_batch_callback's
    # ProcessPoolExecutor (whose fork'd children inherit
    # whatever DuckDB state is live at fork time) is a lazy,
    # process-wide singleton (see pipeline_bridge._get_parse_pool)
    # — it's created only once, on the first call from Rust's
    # parse phase, which starts only after this call returns on
    # this very first run. Every later run reuses the
    # already-created workers, so no new fork ever happens after
    # this point — there's nothing later to inherit a live
    # connection. Must use the provider's full disconnect(),
    # not just closing _connection_manager.connection: the
    # SerialExecutor holds its own separate thread-local DuckDB
    # connection (created lazily on its worker thread), which a
    # bare connection_manager close would leave dangling.
    # `released_for_rust` tracks whether we *attempted* release, not
    # whether it succeeded — release_for_rust_pipeline() can raise after
    # only partially closing its two connections (see its docstring), and
    # the reconnect in `finally` below must still run in that case, or a
    # long-lived server process is left permanently disconnected.
    #
    # Deliberately NOT gated on `db.is_connected`: that property only
    # reflects the connection manager's connection, not the executor's
    # separate thread-local one, and a prior run that failed mid-release
    # can leave the two out of sync. Gating on it meant a `db` left
    # disconnected by an earlier failure skipped this whole block —
    # publishing no ownership flag and never calling release — while Rust
    # still ran below, producing a second native writer on the same file
    # with no guard at all. release_for_rust_pipeline() is idempotent (it
