"""Backup + write for the remote-config pipeline.

Contract:
- Target file resolution: ``CHUNKHOUND_GLOBAL_CONFIG_FILE`` wins if set;
  otherwise the first existing candidate from
  ``Config.get_global_config_candidates()``. If none exist, fall back to
  the **last** candidate — ``~/.chunkhound.json`` — because that's the
  path the loader will discover on the *next* run, keeping fetch and read
  in agreement.
- Backup: ``shutil.copy2(target, target + ".bak")``. Skipped on first-time
  file creation (nothing to preserve).
- Any ``OSError`` on backup or write is a **fatal** operator-visible
  failure — ``sys.exit(1)`` with a message naming source, target, and errno.
  A silent write failure would let the process keep running against a
  stale on-disk copy while advertising success, so the operator loses
  the "did this apply?" signal at exactly the moment they need it most.
