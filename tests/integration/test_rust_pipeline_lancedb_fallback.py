"""CHUNKHOUND_USE_RUST=1 indexes a LanceDB project through the Rust pipeline.

`chunkhound_native.IndexingPipeline` only implements a DuckDB backend
(`DuckDbHnswBackend`). Before this fix, `IndexingCoordinator.process_directory()`
detected `CHUNKHOUND_USE_RUST=1` purely from the env var and gated cleanup /
change-detection / provider-disconnect behavior on that alone — with no check
that the configured database provider was actually DuckDB. Pointed at a
LanceDB-backed project, this disconnected the live LanceDB connection and then
handed the Rust pipeline a `db_path` it can't use (see
`chunkhound/utils/rust_pipeline_flag.py`'s module docstring, which
documented this as a known gap).

The fix checks the provider's `supports_rust_pipeline` capability up front —
before any Rust-specific behavior — and falls back to the Python path for any
provider that doesn't declare it (LanceDB doesn't; only `DuckDBProvider`
does). This test proves indexing still succeeds, through the DB the
provider actually is, when `CHUNKHOUND_USE_RUST=1` is set against LanceDB.
