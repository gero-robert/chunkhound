"""Contract test: a symlinked file's DB row must survive incremental re-indexing.

Regression test for the symlink path-key divergence bug: `run_rust_pipeline()`
(`chunkhound/pipeline_bridge.py`) used to call `Path.resolve()` unconditionally
on every discovered file before crossing into Rust, discarding the symlink's
*logical* path — the one Python's own DB-write path preserves via
`get_relative_path_safe()` (git-worktree support: a symlink's logical path is
kept even when its target resolves outside project_root). The Rust differ
(`src/pipeline/differ.rs`) then re-derived the relative DB key from that
already-resolved absolute path via a naive `strip_prefix`, producing a
different (or missing) key than the one the file's DB row was actually
written under — so an incremental run misclassified the symlink's row as
`removed` and deleted it, even though the file was simultaneously being
processed as `changed`.

The fix moved relative-key computation to Python (the single already-tested
source of truth), passed alongside each absolute path — see
`IndexingPipeline.run()`'s `files: Vec<(String, String)>` parameter. This test
proves the fix end-to-end: index a symlinked file, then re-index incrementally
with zero filesystem changes, and confirm its row is not deleted.
